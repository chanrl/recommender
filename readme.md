## Building a Recommender System

This is a Jupyter notebook showing the workflow for building a recommender using collaborative filtering using Spark and the ALS algorithm.

I was able to achieve a root mean squared error of .924, and potential use cases for this would be targeting certain groups of users for advertising campaigns as well as increase activity on a streaming service by providing accurate predictions on items they would enjoy.
